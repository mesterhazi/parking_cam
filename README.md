# parking_cam

## Goal
The ultimate goal is to use a cheap wide angle parking camera and stream its image to a mobile phone. Preferably without a special app on the phone. 
For this I use:
 - A cheap parking camera with composite video output
 - An Easycap like usb capture device (with stk1160 chip)
 - A raspberry pi (3B+ for now)
